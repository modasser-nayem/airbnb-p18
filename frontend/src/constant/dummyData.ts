You have to be careful cause the steps are quite narrow.  I had a good rest and stay! Will recommend",

The apartment it self was pristine and styled so incredibly well! Overall my partner and i had such an amazing time. Will definitely be staying again once weâ€™re back in BKK.",

Other rooms I looked at nearby I could tell right away they belong to this same host because of the decor. Itâ€™s clear they enjoy creating and using the space. It made me happy to stay here",
